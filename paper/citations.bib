  abstract = "Current methods for inference of phylogenetic trees require
              running complex pipelines at substantial computational and labor
              costs, with additional constraints in sequencing coverage,
              assembly and annotation quality, especially for large datasets.
              To overcome these challenges, we present Read2Tree, which
              directly processes raw sequencing reads into groups of
              corresponding genes and bypasses traditional steps in phylogeny
              inference, such as genome assembly, annotation and all-versus-all
              sequence comparisons, while retaining accuracy. In a benchmark
              encompassing a broad variety of datasets, Read2Tree is 10-100
              times faster than assembly-based approaches and in most cases
              more accurate-the exception being when sequencing coverage is
              high and reference species very distant. Here, to illustrate the
              broad applicability of the tool, we reconstruct a yeast tree of
              life of 435 species spanning 590 million years of evolution. We
              also apply Read2Tree to >10,000 Coronaviridae samples, accurately
              classifying highly diverse animal samples and near-identical
              severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sequences on a
              single tree. The speed, accuracy and versatility of Read2Tree
              enable comparative genomics at scale.",
